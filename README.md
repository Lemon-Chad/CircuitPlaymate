# CircuitPlaymate
A simple circuit playground program that brings your board to life

But what does that mean?
Well, first off, you have to wake up your circuit playmate. Do this by drawing a circle with your finger around the exterior, from the top left to the top right. This should
make it light up as you drag your finger, until each light lights up one by one and it flashes green.

Congratulations! Your playmate is awake! It should start chirping and making occasional noises.

The green lights on your board represent the mood. As time goes on, your playmate will become unhappy, and the green lights will transition to yellow and red. Your playmate will starp chirping more in deeper, unhappier tones. To interact with your pet and make them happy, you can pet them or play a game with them.

To pet them, rub certain parts of the board back and forth. This can be the edges or the back. This should cause blue lights to appear where you're rubbing it. Once you're done, you'll see that your playmate's mood has increased!

To play with them, press the A button twice. This will bring up a game of Simon Says! The longer you play, the faster the patterns are shown. Tap the colors to give your input, and don't mess up! The further you go the happier your playmate will become.
